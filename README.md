# Automated Recommendation Tool (ART)

ART is a tool that leverages machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide metabolic engineering in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic understanding of the biological system. Using sampling-based optimization, ART provides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering cycle in order to achieve the given objective, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels.

## System Requirements

### Hardware requirements
`ART` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.

### Software requirements
#### OS Requirements
This package is supported for *macOS* and *Linux*. The package has been tested on the following systems:
+ macOS: Mojave (10.14.1), Catalina (10.15.1)
+ Linux: Debian 9

## Example

An example is provided in the `Limonene_Example.html` file.
Generating this output in a jupyter notebook should take ~5 mins on a MacBook Pro, CPU: 3.5GHz Intel Core i7, RAM: 16GB (2133MHz LPDDR3).
